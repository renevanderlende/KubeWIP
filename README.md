KubeWIP (Work In Progress)
==========================

My adaptation of the Android OpenGLES Kube sample found in the SDK:
<sdk>\samples\android-17\ApiDemos\src\com\example\android\apis\graphics\kube

Shows a nicely rotating Rubik's cube.

No need to fork this, just my personal OpenGLES playground...

Cheers!
